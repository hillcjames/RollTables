A PC exposed to extreme mental exertion, soul-shivering horror, torture or bearing witness to unspeakable acts or sights can potentially suffer Stress.  Some environmental effects can inflict Stress, such as surviving a particularly nasty battle, or spending several days without food.  Stress can also be generated by encountering certain creature types. Aberrations, Dragons, Fiends, high level Undead or creatures that are at least 5 CR levels higher than the PC can generate Stress for the PC.


If a PC has acquired between 3 - 4 Stress they will suffer a d4 penalty to their attack rolls and skill checks. If a character has 5 - 6 Stress they will suffer a d6 penalty to their attack rolls and skill checks.  Once a PC acquires his/her 7th Stress point, he/she must roll an INT check of DC 10.  If the save fails, the PC must then roll on the Severity 1 Insanity Chart and suffer a random Insanity.

 
If the PC continues to acquire Stress, they must make additional INT checks of increasing difficulty. For every point of Stress over 6, the DC check will increase in difficulty by 1 per point.  Note that the PC's Stress is not lost if an Insanity is acquired.  The player should keep that condition a secret and role-play accordingly. Stress can be removed by the following methods.  Spending a hit die to remove 1 Stress or taking a long rest. Healing magic does not remove Stress. Insanities can only be removed by a number of castings of Greater Restoration, equal to the severity level of the insanity.
